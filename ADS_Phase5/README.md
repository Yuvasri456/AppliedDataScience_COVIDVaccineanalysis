# COVID-19 Vaccine Analysis README

This Jupyter Notebook provides an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 vaccine data, focusing on vaccine efficacy, distribution, and adverse effects. The analysis includes data collection, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and visualization. Below are the steps to run this code:

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn
   ```

## Steps to Run the Code
1. Clone or download the Jupyter Notebook file and the dataset ('country_vaccinations.csv') from [this source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress) to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Jupyter Notebook and the dataset.
3. Start a Jupyter Notebook session:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. In the Jupyter Notebook dashboard, open the 'COVID-19_Vaccine_Analysis.ipynb' file.
5. Run the code cells in the notebook sequentially by clicking on each cell and pressing Shift + Enter.
6. You can interact with the code, view visualizations, and explore the analysis and insights.

## Dataset Used
In this project, we used the COVID-19 vaccine dataset available from the [source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress). The dataset contains information on various aspects of COVID-19 vaccinations across different countries.

## About the Dataset
The dataset consists of several columns, including 'country,' 'iso_code,' 'date,' 'total_vaccinations,' 'people_vaccinated,' 'people_fully_vaccinated,' 'daily_vaccinations_raw,' 'daily_vaccinations,' 'total_vaccinations_per_hundred,' 'people_vaccinated_per_hundred,' 'people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred,' 'daily_vaccinations_per_million,' and 'vaccines.' This data is instrumental in conducting an in-depth analysis and deriving insights into vaccine efficacy, distribution, and related factors.

## Understanding the Code
The code in this notebook is structured into sections, including data loading, data exploration, data visualization, and statistical analysis. The key elements of the code are explained and visualized to aid your understanding.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this code ('country_vaccinations.csv') is assumed to be available in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook. This dataset provides comprehensive information about COVID-19 vaccine progress across various countries, making it a valuable resource for this analysis.
